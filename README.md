# Weather-Prediction

I created a basic rain predictor using the random forest classifier.  It simply predicts a boolean value which is rain or no rain on the Manhattan weather data from 2018 training on the previous year.  
I then predicted the amount of rain and temperature with the xgboost classifier.
I have two more generalized versions called classifier and regressor that focus on the XGBoost versions for predictions.
